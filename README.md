# react-visual-calendar

React Visual Calendar is a responsive, mobile-first visual calendar web application designed to be used by children and by people with autism or other cognitive or developmental disabilities.

Version: 0.0.0 -- At the moment this is an empty framework.

## Goals for 0.0.1:
    1. Install react-slingshot and upgrade to Webpack 2.0.  Configure to use experimental object rest/spread support.
    2. Install react-infinite-calendar.
    3. Establish skeleton application structure with placeholders for all major pages (Main, Day, About, 404).
    4. Set up skeletal testing structure.
    5. Confirm that dev and production builds work as expected. 

## TODO for the next revision:

    1. Figure out what's up with the bundle analyzer and Webpack 2.
    2. Get production build to work (looks like a concatenation error).
    3. Get react-infinite-calendar up on the main page.
    4. Get real tests in place for initial structure.
    5. Reconsider directory structure.

RVC is powered by Cory House's React Slingshot starter kit (https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) and react-infinite-calendar (https://github.com/clauderic/react-infinite-calendar)
